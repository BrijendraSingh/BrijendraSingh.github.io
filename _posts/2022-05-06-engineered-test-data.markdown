What is one of the important factor to a project’s success? If you are a QA then your answer would be Testing, right ? but, what are the important things that makes software testing good ? Answer may vary from person to person based on their experience but I think there is one thing that most of us can relate to, that is good Test Data.

<!-- outline-end -->

This simple logic implies that test data is an important factor for project’s success. Everyone related to software industry would agree on this. So if test data preparation is an important, then why do we seldom ignore it until encounter a problem?

Testing is not going to be an easy task even though QA’s have become more informed and effective. They will always rely on good test data in order to provide satisfactory software quality.
### Below are some common test data problems that can be encountered at the time of software testing

#### Data aggregation/Batch run:
Having prod equivalent data volume in lower environment will result

* longer batch/aggregation processing time.
* more data storage space
* uncertainty of corner/edge cases or any specific testing scenario requirement.
* querying data for validation will consume significant time
* automated test might timeout or take unappreciated longer time due to time consuming run time query execution. {: .notice}

#### Data complexity:
Production equivalent Test data is not simple and straightforward 

* Sometimes the test data is not simple and straightforward. Testers may need to learn new terminologies, patterns, standards in order to understand the flow/use of data.
* Data might be entangled with multiple sources , tables or schemas , etc.
* Some scenarios may not even be possible to test in the test environment. In this instance, testers may need to devote a good amount of time to * understand the scenarios and come up with a new and efficient way to prepare the data.{: .notice}

#### Data accessibility:
Test Data access, dependencies on multiple teams consuming it

* Access to data manipulation might be restricted since multiple people, teams can be using it and the tester will not always be able to manipulate the data, as required.
* QA’s have to manipulate the data in the test database before figuring out what specifically needed to be changed. Significant amount of time is spent on * learning the databases names, table relations, column data, and their correspondence to the application, their properties and constraints.{: .notice}

#### Inefficient processes:
Another challenge that Testers may face is dealing with inefficient processes. By challenging the client’s current process and introducing a new, more * efficient model, team should be able to produce a quicker way for testers to fill in accurate data.

### Lets talk about challenges we faced in our project

</figure>
- prod equivalent data volume on lower environments
- data size > 500 gb (> 40 interrelated tables having millions of rows)
- batch processing takes longer than 8 hours, if any thing go wrong it takes a complete day to take and act on a feedback.
- cloud data storage cost
- multiple teams are consuming the environment and hence ad hoc changes in data will disrupt rest of the teams and activities to cover edge cases or any specific testing scenarios.
- views and procedures used to validate the final data outcome on UI takes extra maintenance activity over sprints and longer query execution time (millions of rows has complex joins with multiple tables)


### Solution

- our first thought was to reduce the execution time for → aggregation/batch processing (faster feedback) → quick sql query execution (faster manual and automated test feedback)
- client was migrating to cloud so data store space cost was also being considered

Taking an Iterative approach would make data reduction process a little more easier. It will also help us build confidence on reduced test data reliability to suffice QA and automation testing needs. Below are the Major steps we took in order to start the data reduction.{: .notice}
