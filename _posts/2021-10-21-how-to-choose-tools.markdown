> Finding right tool for automation testing is very crucial. Wrong selection of tool may cause trouble and can also result of rework and limitations. 

## How do you choose a tool ?

## Things that should really matter
* Scalability
* Compatibility across browsers
* Compatibility across OS
* Ease of creating test scripts 
* Easy maintenance
* Reporting mechanism
* Price

## A tale of 2 teams
### Team A
- Cost sensitive client
- Team comfortable with many languages
- Application needs to support IE, Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Responsive design
- Strict performance benchmarks
- Asynchronous backend systems	

### Team B
- Client maintains own tech stack preferences
- Team comfortable with Java and JavaScript
- Support needed majorly for in-house Chrome users
- Possibility of training end-users after going live
- Client comfortable with tools support cost

## The Paradox of choice
Number of choices increases due to:
- Available list of tools/frameworks - Democratization of source code led to development of tools with similar features but subtle differences
- Team constraints/preferences
- Client requirements

## PUGH MATRIX
The Pugh Matrix is a decision-making tool to compare multiple alternatives. The steps that you will take to create your Pugh Matrix are:

- Define your evaluation criteria. What are the most important and desired characteristics of your solution?
- Weight your evaluation criteria as to the relative importance of each.
- Define your different improvement alternatives and optional approaches.
- Select a “BASELINE” from the alternatives, which will typically be your current state.
- For each criteria, rate each alternative as better, same, or worse than your baseline. You can use a simple + for better, s for same, and – for worse.
- Total the count of each.
- Select your best alternative.
- Explore whether an even more optimal solution might exist by creating a hybrid of the best from various alternatives.
