## How do you choose a tool ?

## Things that should really matter
* Scalability
* Compatibility across browsers
* Compatibility across OS
* Ease of creating test scripts 
* Easy maintenance
* Reporting mechanism
* Price

## A tale of 2 teams
### Team A
- Cost sensitive client
- Team comfortable with many languages
- Application needs to support IE, Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Responsive design
- Strict performance benchmarks
- Asynchronous backend systems	

### Team B
- Client maintains own tech stack preferences
- Team comfortable with Java and JavaScript
- Support needed majorly for in-house Chrome users
- Possibility of training end-users after going live
- Client comfortable with tools support cost

## The Paradox of choice
Number of choices increases due to:
- Available list of tools/frameworks - Democratization of source code led to development of tools with similar features but subtle differences
- Team constraints/preferences
- Client requirements
